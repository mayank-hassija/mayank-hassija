> *therefore the character needs to be tested, it is in hardships that we see who we really are. we don‘t even know ourselves before we realize we‘ve achieved what we didn‘t think we could. that‘s why we need to know where we stand, we need to realize how dependent we actually are on god, and we need to know that we can‘t even move without him. we have a loving creator "god is love", and just as a parent will not let his child tough the hot stove, because of love, the same way, god in his wisdom cannot fulfill all our requests all the time. he is working in our interest anyway!*
