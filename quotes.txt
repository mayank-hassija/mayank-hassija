Negative thinking results in the destruction of property. It is anti-property, therefore anticapitalistic and anti-life. It also erodes your health. Forgive, learn your lessons, and get on with your life.
Nervous about your exams or didn't do good in them? That's not the end, the road is still there, you are still on your feet and the destination is waiting for your arrival. So, give a pat on your back and say, 'Boy let's go, we can do this together!
Never cut a tree down in the wintertime. Never make an important negative decision in the low times of your life. Never make your most important decisions when you are in your worst moods. Wait. Be patient. The storm will pass. The spring will come.
Never enter into nor invest in a business without a solid, well-researched and well thought-out written plan. Execute the plan with passion and precision. Plan and manage your life the same way.
Ninety percent of being successful in life is just showing up. The other ten percent is a combination of paying attention once you‘re there and contributing one hundred percent of everything you‘ve got. Hold nothing back. Anything less is unacceptable.
